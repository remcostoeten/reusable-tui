// TestProgramBootsAndQuits drives the real Bubble Tea loop rather than calling
// Update by hand. It covers what the model-level tests cannot: that the
// program starts, paints a frame to a terminal and shuts down cleanly.
//
// It deliberately asserts nothing about the middle of a key sequence. The
// renderer emits diffs, so what reaches the byte stream depends on which cells
// changed; the sequences themselves are asserted against real state in
// app_test.go, which is both stronger and stable.
